# resumeParser

A Flask-based web application for parsing resumes and extracting key information such as name, email, phone, skills, education, and companies.

## Features

- Upload resumes in PDF or DOCX format
- Extracts personal information, skills, education, and work experience
- Displays parsed data in a user-friendly interface
- Search and filter resumes
- Stores parsed data in a SQLite database

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- spaCy
- python-docx
- PyPDF2
- SQLite

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Upload a resume and view the parsed results

## How It Works

- The app uses spaCy for advanced name/entity detection.
- Uploaded resumes are parsed for key information using regular expressions and NLP.
- Parsed data is saved to a database and displayed in the web interface.

## Improving Name Detection

If the name is not detected, the app uses spaCy NER and heading heuristics to improve accuracy. See `app.py` for details.
